      <h2>Poem: Hold My Hand 🤝</h2>
      <p>
        Hold my hand,<br>
        not just for now,<br>
        but until time forgets our names<br>
        and the stars no longer shine.<br><br>

        Hold it through storms,<br>
        through silence,<br>
        through the soft fading of our days.<br><br>

        And when the fire of life dims,<br>
        when we turn to ashes,<br>
        let our hands still speak<br>
        what words could never hold,<br>
        forever.

      <h2>Poem: Ten Years From Now 💌</h2>
      <p>
        Ten years from now,<br>
        I want to see myself loving the same person I love today,<br>
        with the same smile,<br>
        the same spark that started it all.<br><br>

        I dream of mornings with the same soul,<br>
        coffee in hand, hearts at ease,<br>
        you beside me then, now, and always.<br><br>

        Not because it’s easy,<br>
        but because it’s you.<br>
        And loving you…<br>
        was never just a phase.<br><br>

        And if the universe allows,<br>
        I hope it's still you,<br>
        the one my heart knew<br>
        before time ever asked it to decide.
