            <h3>Hold My Hand</h3>
            <p>
                Hold my hand,<br>
                not just for now,<br>
                but until time forgets our names<br>
                and the stars no longer shine.<br><br>

                Hold it through storms,<br>
                through silence,<br>
                through the soft fading of our days.<br><br>

                And when the fire of life dims,<br>
                when we turn to ashes,<br>
                let our hands still speak<br>
                what words could never hold,<br>
                forever.

            <h3>Ten Years From Now</h3>
            <p>
                Ten years from now,<br>
                I want to see myself loving the same person I love today,<br>
                with the same smile,<br>
                the same spark that started it all.<br><br>

                I dream of mornings with the same soul,<br>
                coffee in hand, hearts at ease,<br>
                you beside me then, now, and always.<br><br>

                Not because itâ€™s easy,<br>
                but because itâ€™s you.<br>
                And loving youâ€¦<br>
                was never just a phase.<br><br>

                And if the universe allows,<br>
                I hope it's still you,<br>
                the one my heart knew<br>
                before time ever asked it to decide.
